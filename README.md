# Red-Black Tree Implementation  

## Overview  

This project provides an implementation of a **Red-Black Tree**, a self-balancing binary search tree, written in **Java**. The Red-Black Tree ensures that the tree remains balanced, resulting in efficient operations for insertion, deletion, and search with a time complexity of **O(log n)**.  

Additionally, this implementation includes a **JavaFX-based graphical visualization**, allowing users to interact with the tree dynamically.  

## Features  

- **Insertion** of elements while maintaining the Red-Black Tree properties  
- **Deletion** of elements with automatic rebalancing  
- **Searching** for a specific element  
- **Tree Traversals** (in-order, pre-order, post-order)  
- **Graphical Visualization** using **JavaFX** for an interactive experience  

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  

Ensure you have the following installed:  

- **Java Development Kit (JDK 11 or later)**  
- **JavaFX SDK** (included in newer JDKs or available separately)  
- **An IDE** such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans (recommended for JavaFX development)  

### Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mahajialirezaei/RedBlackTree.git
   ```  
2. Open the project in your IDE.  
3. Ensure JavaFX libraries are correctly configured in the project settings.  
4. Compile and run the project:  
   ```sh
   javac -d out --module-path <path-to-javafx-lib> --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml *.java
   java --module-path <path-to-javafx-lib> --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -cp out Main
   ```  
   *(Replace `<path-to-javafx-lib>` with the actual JavaFX SDK path.)*  

## Usage  

Once the application is running, you can:  

- Insert elements by entering values in the graphical interface.  
- Delete elements from the tree dynamically.  
- Search for a specific element.  
- View the tree structure visually with dynamic updates.  

## Red-Black Tree Properties  

The tree maintains the following properties:  

1. Every node is either **red** or **black**.  
2. The **root** node is always **black**.  
3. **Red** nodes cannot have **red** children (no two consecutive red nodes).  
4. Every path from a node to its descendant **NULL** nodes must have the same number of **black** nodes.  

## Example (Java Implementation)  

```java
RedBlackTree tree = new RedBlackTree();
tree.insert(10);
tree.insert(20);
tree.insert(30);
tree.insert(15);
tree.display();
```

This inserts elements into the tree while maintaining Red-Black properties and displays the tree structure.  

## Contributing  

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues or pull requests to improve the implementation.
